TL;DR: We're quacking along with order #{order_number}

Thank you for joining us on this awesome journey. You'll soon have a new quacking companion to not only debug with, but also take with you for bathtime. Or do whatever you do with ducks.

As ducks are shipping from the UK, we'll be prioritising requests in the following order:

1. UK, including Northern Ireland
2. EU, including the Republic of Ireland
3. Wider Europe, including Russia and Turkey
4. Canada
5. US

Each duck will cost Â£2.50, plus postage and packaging. I'll inform you of postage and payment closer to the delivery date.
