Hello!

THE DUCKS HAVE SHIPPED. I REPEAT, THE DUCKS HAVE SHIPPED.

Yes, you read that right. The ducks are paddling (while on a massive ship) to the UK right now. We'll have more information on delivery and payment you once the ducks have arrived at our secure warehouse location (read as Leo's flat).

We're figuring out how to deliver safely in line with UK industry best practice and current coronavirus regulations, and we're also considering duck pick up. If you prefer one over the other, let us know.

Your sweet, sweet lambda ducks will soon be in your possession, and we're looking forward to it.

Cheers,

Josh and Leo.
